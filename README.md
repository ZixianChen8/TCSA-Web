# TCSA-Web
Official Website for the University of Ottawa, Telfer Chinese Student Association (TCSA)
This project is currently in early development stage.

This project is a corporate website for TCSA, designed to provide information about the association and its events. The current focus is on setting up the database, implementing the event registration feature, and establishing a scalable and maintainable codebase.

This project is built with Django as the backend framework, React (using Vite) as the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The project aims to provide a streamlined corporate website with an event registration feature, with the potential to add user accounts in the future.
